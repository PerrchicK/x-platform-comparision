# x-platform-meetup
(this repo should demonstrate the differences between the most popular 3 cross platform frameworks, currently it contains only the Flutter example we prepared upfront. The other 2 won't be necessarily uploaded, watch the repo to get notified about changes)

The slides from the [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/full-stack-developer-il/events/264154120/) can be found here:

In this repository you will find an example for a Flutter app, the app is able to:

- Load a JSON of images from Flickr with pagination (requires a key of your own).
- Scan QR code with camera.
- Example of Flare animations usage.
- Splash screen usage (using a custom bridge)
- Simple animations

Enjoy!
